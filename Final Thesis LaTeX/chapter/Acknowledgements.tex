I am most grateful to Prof. Piotr Wojciech Dabrowski, whose guidance, support, and instruction have been key throughout the journey of this research. His insight has been invaluable, and his guidance has been the foundation on which this work has been built.

My sincere gratitude goes to Prof. Alexei Gurevich, whose dissertation "Computational Methods for Analysis of Error-Prone Metabologenomic Data" not only inspired my research but was also an integral part of the development of the software used in this thesis.

A special acknowledgment goes to my parents. Their sacrifices and love have not gone unnoticed and have been the quiet, constant force that has fueled my resolve, especially through the unique challenges of my studies abroad.
